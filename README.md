# snap-client-go

This repo has Snap restful Go clients generated by [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger). You can run the following command to view available Snap APIs locally.
> swagger serve swagger.json --host=127.0.0.1

You can browse and test Snap APIs interactively by leveraging tools like [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) or [apistudio.io](http://apistudio.io/).

If any change for swagger.json specification, running the command 'make' to generate a new client.

The directory `test` contains integration tests that verify the generated client library if it is working appropriately against the actual behavior of the Snap APIs. Tests will fail if any incompatible change in the API.  Package `test` verifies the following APIs:

* Metric
* Plugin
* Plugin Config
* Task

For your convenience, the Docker and docker-compose based medium test is available for you to try Snap APIs out.  You can run:  

```
make test-medium
```
