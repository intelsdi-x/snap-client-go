# snap-client-go

This repo has Snap restful Go clients generated by [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger). You can run the following command to view available Snap APIs locally.
> swagger serve swagger.json --host=127.0.0.1

 You can browse and test Snap APIs interactively by leveraging tools like [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) or [apistudio.io](http://apistudio.io/).

The directory `test` contains integration tests that verify the generated client library if it is working appropriately against the actual behavior of the Snap APIs. Tests will fail if any incompatible change in the API.

For all integration tests to pass, besides Snap is running, the following three plugins need to be loaded:
* [file publisher](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-publisher-file)
* [snap-plugin-collector-mock1](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/tree/master/plugin/collector/snap-plugin-collector-mock1)
* [snap-plugin-collector-mock2](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/tree/master/plugin/collector/snap-plugin-collector-mock2)
