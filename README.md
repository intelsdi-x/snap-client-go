# snap-client-go

## Overview

This repo has [Snap](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap) restful Go clients generated by [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger). You can run the following command to view available Snap APIs locally.
> swagger serve swagger.json --host=127.0.0.1

You can browse and test Snap APIs interactively by leveraging tools like [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) or [apistudio.io](http://apistudio.io/).

If any change for swagger.json specification, running the command 'make' to generate a new client.

## Running tests

The package `test` contains integration tests that verify the generated client library if it is working appropriately against the actual behavior of the Snap APIs. Tests will fail if any incompatible change in the API.  Package `test` verifies the following APIs:

* Metric
 * Get the available metric list
* Plugin & Config
 * Load a plugin
 * Unload a plugin
 * Get a giving plugin details
 * Get the loaded plugin list
 * Get a giving plugin Config
 * Set a giving plugin Config
 * Delete a giving plugin config
* Task
 * Create a task
 * Get a list of tasks
 * Get a giving task details
 * Update a task state
 * Watch a task
 * Delete a task

For your convenience, the Docker and docker-compose based medium test is available for you to try out.  You can run:  

```
make test-medium
```
